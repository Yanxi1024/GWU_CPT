Dear Ms. Jefferies,

Thank you for the assistance you have provided me.

Attached to this email, you will find my proposal. However, I am currently awaiting an updated offer document from the company that hired me. I will send you this document as soon as I receive it.

Thank you once again for your help. Let me know if you need any additional information from my side.

Best regards,

Yanxi Li

Dear Mr. Marconi,

I hope you are doing well. I recently discussed my CPT application with my professional advisor at my school. She informed me that the last day to participate in CPT for the Fall 2024 semester is December 17, 2024. However, the last day in my TOR document is December 20, so we need to adjust this date to align with the university's requirement.

Thank you for you help.

Best regards,

Yanxi Li
